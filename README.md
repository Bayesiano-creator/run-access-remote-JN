# Run and acess a Jupyter Notebook hosted on a remote server

This tutorial will show you how to run a Jupyter Notebook on a remote server and connect to it from another computer as if it were running locally. The goal is to make it a comfortable and fast process, especially for cases where you need to connect frequently and sometimes to more than one Jupyter Notebook session. To achieve this, we'll be using two tools: the **screen** command and the **Termius** SSH client app.
